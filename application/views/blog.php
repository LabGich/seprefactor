                                On the 8<sup>th</sup> of September, 2021, Social Empowerment Project, hosted Bundesliga Youth Ambassadors (BUYAS) for a self- paced comprehensive learning program. The BUYAS arrived on the evening of 7<sup>th</sup> September, 2021.

                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                &nbsp;

                                This program a partnership with TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, street footballworld and Transforming Young Stars of Africa was to enable the BUYAS interact and learn from each other and  share what activities they undertake at their respective organizations. The wins and the challenges as well. A few success stories from the BUYAS and some challenging stories encouraged everyone to keep doing what they do and not to give up.

                                A moving and encouraging speech from the director of S.E.P, Mr. Festus Juma, was a highlight of day 1, with rich lessons on mental health, reproductive health and healthy relationships being the main message. He welcomed the BUYAS to Oyugis town, Homa Bay County and briefed them on the activities that the S.E.P- BUYAS have been undertaking. Apart from empowering the community and young girls through sports, they empower them economically to through skill based projects.

                                &nbsp;

                                &nbsp;

                                The afternoon session involved showing the BUYAS what S.E.P does in the communities. This involved a visit to the farms where they do poultry and horticulture farming. The farming is done by SEP members in the community. The farmers are given partitions of land and fertilizers, as well as poultry and poultry feeds, which they use to farm and eventually get food and income. This is part of the economic empowerment.

                                SEP, CO-director, Lourraine, also briefed the BUYAS on the reproductive health department, where she showed them how the department makes and manages re-usable sanitary pads. In her talk, she talked about menstrual hygiene, pads drives and the reproductive health sessions that they hold with the young and adolescent girls. This department also takes credit for empowering the young women and girls through tailoring courses.

                                Finally, the BUYAS were showed to the football pitch at K’Otieno primary school where they actively interacted with pupils who were on their games break. They later had a friendly match with Oyugis football club team.

                                SEP was humbled and honored to host a successful first day of BUYAS in Oyugis!

                                On the second day, BUYAS were treated to a historic trip to Lake Simbi, in Homa Bay County. Lake Simbi boasts of beautiful flamingoes which are a tourist attraction to the lake. Here they were told about the intriguing story behind the formation of Lake Simbi. They enjoyed a hike around the lake towards the flamingoes. They enjoyed the beautiful views, which they captured well.

                                Later on, they team went to Kendu bay old town, a harbor off Kendu bay town. Here, they enjoyed a boat ride on the Lake Victoria, from the local fishermen.

                                Some of the BUYAS were lucky to order for and eat fresh, hot deep fried fish right from the lake!

                                <p><strong>Youth Self-help Agriculture Program</strong>

                                    SEP, through its innovative Youth Self- help Agriculture Program, helps ensure food security, financially empowers youth,  (girls and boys) provides valuable agricultural training, and supports youth’s access to education.  SEP works with local families to dedicate a small percent of the families’ own crop land to the care of a youth family member.  The child is then responsible for planting, maintaining, and harvesting this plot.  After basic food security needs of the family are met, all proceeds of crop sales from the child’s plot go to the child and are used to fund a portion of their school-related expenses.  The families must commit to funding the remaining portion of the school expenses.

                                    <strong>SEP’s Role:</strong>
                                <ul>

                                It is envisaged by SEP leadership that the above cited planned activities are suitable points for collaboration. We therefore reach out to MIT – D-Lab (Class of Agriculture) to consider sharing any inputs in this context.

                                <strong>SEP Football Program </strong>

                                SEP aims to use football to mobilize, engage, and educate youth on life skills, health issues, and a wide variety of other topics. Football is the channel that we use to deliver key messages to the youths in our community. Through the power of “developmental football,” SEP’s specially trained coaches provide not only fun, but important life skills to develop the next generation of community leaders.

                                SEP’s unique Youth Football Program leverages the power of football as a tool to:
