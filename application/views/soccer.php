                                <p><strong><span style="color: #8d2424;">&#8220;&#8230;sport is not just physical activity; it promotes health and helps prevent, or even cure, the diseases of modern civilization. It also is an educational tool which fosters cognitive development; teaches social behaviour; and helps to integrate communities.&#8221;</span></strong><br />

                                    <p>SEP aims to use football to mobilize, engage, and educate youth on life skills, health issues, and a wide variety of other topics. Football is the channel that we use to deliver key messages to the youths in our community. Through the power of “developmental football,” SEP’s specially trained coaches provide not only fun, but important life skills to develop the next generation of community leaders.</p>
                                    <p>SEP’s unique Youth Football Program leverages the power of football as a tool to:<br />
                                        • Teach life skills through games and integrated messaging in areas such as HIV/AIDS prevention, health and sanitation, Agriculture &amp; nutrition, reproductive health, peace building, and substance abuse<br />
